//what is a promise:
//its a js object that wraps an operation.
//this promise is eventually marked as "settled" , whenever the operation is complete.
// you mark it settled by using the "then" method.

//the then method takes a function as an argument and that function is executed when the promise is settled.

//promises help you prevent the "callback hell"

//you can define a step by step chain for async operations.
